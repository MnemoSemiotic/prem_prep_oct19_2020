        * trinary ex: [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]

    * Coding mathematical formulations

    * Analysis through Dictionaries
        * Pack values into dictionaries
            * Check membership vs not checking membership

So what are some good identifiers of when we should use which?  I.e. when we should use Binomial vs when we should use Poisson

Consider that Poisson events (successes) can occur nearly simultaneously, whereas Binomial events are discretized into unique moments/trials/observations
