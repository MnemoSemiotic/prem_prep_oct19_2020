You have a satellite that takes stellar images of random places in space. On average, each image has 30 stars in it. What is the probability that a given image has 25 stars in it?

e is a constant, a factor of entropy, and it applies in Poisson process


Criteria we need for Poisson:
an average for a given volume/area/length of time
each event needs to be independent
assumption that the rate is consistent, (independent and identical distribution)
